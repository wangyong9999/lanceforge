## [0.4.0-alpha.1] — 2026-04-24

Single logical dataset on S3 with fragment-level distributed
execution, delivered on top of the alpha.3 multi-shard baseline
(still the default for legacy tables).  Built as the MVP for
"logical single dataset + distributed execution + fully stateless
workers + affinity routing" — a user requirement alpha.1/alpha.2
got wrong by conflating the two axes.

Branches off `v0.3.0-alpha.3`; the multi-shard path is untouched
for every table not explicitly created as single-dataset.

### Added

- **Phase 0 — worker `refine_factor`** on ANN search
  (`execute_on_table` and fragment-scan path). lancedb's built-in
  re-rank reads original vectors for the PQ shortlist and returns
  true L2 in `_distance`, so the coord's cross-worker top-K merge
  is correct even when each shard has its own PQ codebook.
  Isolated bench on 500k × 128d × 2 shards with in-memory brute-
  force ground truth: **recall 0.522 → 0.973** (`phase0_rerank.rs`,
  requires `--release --ignored`).

- **Phase 1 — fungible worker primitive**. `LocalSearchRequest`
  and `LocalWriteRequest` gain an optional `shard_uri` field.
  When set and the table is not in the worker's registry, the
  worker idempotently calls `open_table(name, uri)` before
  serving. Workers boot with zero preloaded shards and pick up
  work as dispatched. (`phase1_fungible.rs`)

- **Phase 2 — coord fragment fanout for single-shard tables**.
  `fragment_dispatch::dispatch_fragment_fanout` enumerates Lance
  fragments via a cached `DatasetCache`, HRW-routes subsets to
  healthy workers via `fragment_router::assign_fragments`, and
  merges with the existing `global_top_k_by_distance` (correct
  across workers thanks to Phase 0). `ann_search` auto-selects
  this path when routing returns exactly one ShardConfig entry.
  (`phase2_single_dataset.rs`)

- **Phase 3 — single-primary writer via HRW**. AddRows for
  single-shard tables routes through `worker_select::
  pick_worker_for_write` (FNV hash of `table_name`). Multi-coord
  deployments converge on the same primary without lease /
  election. Write throughput is bounded by Lance OCC (~100-500
  commits/s on S3), consistent with ADR-001. Writes ship
  `shard_uri` so the primary lazy-opens if it wasn't preloaded.
  (`phase3_single_writer.rs`)

- **DatasetCache invalidation on commit** — after a successful
  single-shard AddRows, coord drops its cached Lance handle for
  the URI. The next read reopens and enumerates the current
  fragment set. Without this, read-after-write would return
  stale results. Regression test:
  `phase3_read_after_write_sees_new_rows`.

- **`ConnectionPool::wait_until_healthy(expected, timeout)`** —
  polls worker_statuses at 50 ms cadence until the healthy worker
  count reaches `expected`. Replaces the `sleep(2_000ms)` pattern
  in phase-2 and phase-3 tests; cuts test runtime from ~2.5 s to
  ~0.6 s each and removes a source of CI flakes.

- **`crates/coordinator/src/fragment_router.rs`** (already landed
  in alpha.3's verification commit as a PoC artifact) is now
  production-used by the phase-2 dispatcher.

### Protocol

- `LocalSearchRequest.fragment_ids` (`repeated uint32`, tag 13) —
  when non-empty, worker scans only the listed fragments via
  `Scanner::with_fragments + prefilter + nearest`.
- `LocalSearchRequest.shard_uri` (`optional string`, tag 14) —
  lazy-open directive for fungible workers.
- `LocalWriteRequest.shard_uri` (`optional string`, tag 7) —
  same for writes.

### Changed

- `crates/coordinator/Cargo.toml`: added `lance = "4.0"`
  (needed for `Dataset::open` at the coord during fragment
  enumeration). No runtime cost on the legacy multi-shard path.

### Test evidence

- Workspace lib tests: 546 green.
- `phase1_fungible` 2/2, `phase2_single_dataset` 1/1,
  `phase3_single_writer` 2/2 (includes the read-after-write
  regression guard).
- `phase0_rerank --ignored --release`: mean recall 0.973, min
  0.900 (40 queries, 500k × 128d × 2 shards).

### Not yet in this alpha

Intentional deferrals — tracked for 0.4.0-alpha.2+:

- NVMe fragment-byte cache. PoC Gate 2 bench put the no-cache
  delta at ~2.5× p99 vs the multi-shard baseline; this is the
  gap Enterprise's consistent-hash PE cache closes.
- Asynchronous/event-driven index build. Current IDX is still
  polling-driven.
- Tunable consistency beyond strong + `min_commit_seq` (no
  bounded-staleness / session handles yet).
- `lance-admin migrate` for converting alpha.3 multi-shard data
  into a single dataset. Early adopters recreate the table.

## [0.3.0-alpha.3] — 2026-04-22

Distributed vector search restored. alpha.1 had flipped the coord
from multi-worker scatter-gather to single-worker dispatch under a
single-dataset assumption; alpha.2 then deleted the scatter-gather
code outright. That removed the ability for one query to use CPU
from multiple nodes, which is the core requirement for 100B-row /
1K-dim scale. alpha.3 reverts those commits and re-applies the
orthogonal incremental improvements (DDL ops, Tags, Restore, index
types) on top of the restored multi-shard architecture.

### Restored (via git revert)
- Coord scatter-gather dispatch on AnnSearch / FtsSearch /
  HybridSearch / CountRows — one query fans out to every shard's
  primary worker, coord merges global top-K.
- Write-path hash partitioning — AddRows / UpsertRows with
  on_columns route each row to its owning shard.
- CreateTable auto-sharding — new tables get one shard per healthy
  worker (data spreads automatically).
- MoveShard / rebalance path and the connection-pool recovery that
  LoadShards assigned shards on worker reconnect.
- scatter_gather.rs, shard_pruning.rs, partition_batch_by_hash,
  ShardPruner field, on_columns_for helper, add_rows_hash_partitioned.

### Kept from alpha.1/alpha.2 (orthogonal improvements)
- **AlterTable DROP / RENAME** column (Lance metadata-only,
  fan-out + DDL lease). `e2e_schema_evolution` 18/18.
- **Tags CRUD + RestoreTable** — alpha.3 rewrites the coord
  handlers to fan-out across every shard (alpha.1 only touched
  routing[0] which was wrong for multi-shard tables).
  `e2e_tags_test` 22/22.
- **CreateIndex** full dispatch for IVF_FLAT / IVF_PQ /
  IVF_HNSW_SQ / IVF_HNSW_PQ / BTREE / BITMAP / LABEL_LIST /
  FTS (fixes v0.2's silent IVF_FLAT fallthrough bug).
- Worker `OpenTable` / `CloseTable` RPCs — table-oriented
  alternatives to LoadShard/UnloadShard, idempotent.
- `worker_select` module — dormant but available for operations
  that target a single shard / worker.
- 5 Architecture Decision Records under `docs/adr/` — ADR-001
  and ADR-002 remain applicable; ADR-003 / 004 / 005 are
  superseded notes on the single-dataset path we chose not to
  take.

### Removed (alpha.3 cleanup)
- `lance-admin migrate` subcommand — it converted v0.2 shards/*
  to v0.3 single-dataset table_uris/*; with multi-shard restored,
  it has no target and would mislead operators.
- `r4_migrate_*` unit tests.

### Breaking from alpha.2
- Anyone who ran `lance-admin migrate --commit` on alpha.1/alpha.2
  has written `table_uris/*` entries the coord no longer reads.
  Rollback: delete those keys; existing `shards/*` keys still
  drive routing.
- `n_shards = 1` from alpha.2 is reversed; CreateTable now spreads
  across workers again.

### Test evidence
- Workspace lib tests: 655+ green.
- E2E 13/13 green (smoke bench inclusive).
- `e2e_tags_test` 22/22 under multi-shard fan-out.
- `e2e_schema_evolution_test` 18/18.

## [0.3.0-alpha.1] — 2026-04-22

Single-dataset realignment, alpha-grade first cut. One logical
table now maps to one Lance dataset in object storage; the multi-
shard-per-table model from v0.2 is retained as a compatibility
path pending R6 removal. See:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_V3_SINGLE_DATASET.md` — design rationale.
- `docs/REALIGNMENT_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md` — v0.2→v0.3 mapping.
- `docs/REALIGNMENT_PARITY_REPORT.md` — actual landing state.
- `docs/REALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` — phase sequence R0..R6.
- `docs/adr/ADR-00{1..5}*.md` — architectural decisions.

### Added
- **AlterTable DROP / RENAME** (Lance metadata-only): worker calls
  `drop_columns` / `alter_columns` through a schema_store-backed
  coord handler. `e2e_schema_evolution_test.py` 18/18.
- **Tags**: `CreateTag` / `ListTags` / `DeleteTag` RPCs on the
  scheduler service; pass-through to Lance native `tags()` API.
  `e2e_tags_test.py` 22/22.
- **RestoreTable(version | tag)**: rolls back the Lance dataset to
  a prior version or tag; a new manifest records the restore.
- **CreateIndex** full dispatch: IVF_FLAT, IVF_PQ, IVF_HNSW_SQ,
  IVF_HNSW_PQ, BTREE, BITMAP, LABEL_LIST, FTS/INVERTED. v0.2
  silently fell through IVF_HNSW_SQ and IVF_PQ to IVF_FLAT — that
  bug is fixed; unknown types now return `Plan` error with the
  supported list.
- Worker `OpenTable` / `CloseTable` RPCs as the table-oriented
  handle surface alongside the legacy shard-oriented pair.
- Coord `dispatch_read` helper with single-worker dispatch via
  `worker_select::pick_worker_for_read`.
- 5 Architecture Decision Records under `docs/adr/`.

### Changed
- Coord read handlers (AnnSearch / FtsSearch / HybridSearch /
  CountRows) take the single-worker path when the table maps to
  exactly one shard — the default and only case for tables created
  under v0.3. Legacy multi-shard tables still scatter-gather.
- Write handlers (AddRows / UpsertRows / DeleteRows) skip hash-
  partition fan-out when the table has one shard.
- DDL lease retained for CreateTable / DropTable; AlterTable and
  CreateIndex rely on Lance's manifest CAS for atomicity
  (ADR-004).

### Deferred to later alphas
- Time travel reads (`version` / `tag` on AnnSearch / CountRows) —
  needs per-query version-scoped handles.
- Fully fungible worker routing (R2).
- `lance-admin migrate` for v0.2 multi-shard data conversion (R4).
- OTEL trace context propagation (R5).
- Dead-code purge: `scatter_gather.rs`, `shard_pruning.rs`,
  `shard_state.rs`, `shard_manager.rs`, `partition_batch_by_hash`,
  and the deprecated proto messages/fields (R6, together).

### Not-broken from v0.2
- RPC API surface: all v0.2 RPCs remain. New RPCs added; fields on
  existing messages only appended (wire-compat).
- Data layout: v0.2 multi-shard tables are still readable via the
  retained scatter-gather path.
- E2E parity: 13/13 (with occasional port-contention flakes that
  clear in isolation).

## [0.2.0-beta.5] — 2026-04-21

See the release notes in the tag message — v2 architecture (4-role
composition), distributed primitives #5.1–#5.5 + #3, and the
hardening pass (idempotent AlterTable + coverage extensions). This
is the final release of the multi-shard architecture; v0.3 begins
the single-dataset realignment.

## [0.2.0-beta.4] - 2026-04-20

Coverage-first hardening pass + honest fix for an overstated SSE
claim. D1-D8 + the SSE-C correction.

### Fixed
- SECURITY.md §6.3 SSE-C claim: `storage_options.aws_server_side_
  encryption_customer_*` keys don't actually encrypt (empirically
  verified against MinIO). Docs rewritten; SSE-C deferred to 0.3.
- `lance-admin shards copy` OOM risk: refactored from
  `get().bytes().await` to `put_multipart` above a configurable
  threshold. Streaming now keeps memory bounded by one chunk.
- `lance-admin shards copy` fail-fast on single-object error:
  added `--continue-on-error` + summary report.

### Added
- D1 MinIO SSE-S3 e2e (`e2e_minio_sse_test.py`) + CI services block.
- D4 namespace prefix proptests (512 cases × 4 properties).
- D5 MetaStore S3 real-MinIO integration test (`MINIO_E2E_TEST=1`).
- D6 audit_dropped_total e2e (`e2e_audit_dropped_test.py`).
- D7 worker `#[tracing::instrument]` explicit `trace_id` field.
- D8 write-path per-shard latency log (add_rows fan-out; H13 parity).
- `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`, `docs/CI_MATRIX.md`, `docs/RELEASE.md`
  added in earlier beta.3 commits — remain authoritative.

### Changed
- `cmd_shards_copy` signature: now takes `continue_on_error: bool` +
  `multipart_threshold: u64`. Test call sites updated.
- `SECURITY.md` §6.3 rewritten to reflect the actual storage_options
  capabilities (bucket-level SSE works, per-request SSE-C doesn't).
- `LIMITATIONS.md` §10 adds explicit "SSE-C not supported" entry
  with technical reason + workaround.

### Deferred to 0.3
- SSE-C support via custom object_store wrapper (the real fix).
- B2.3 Write batching (confirmed as cross-backend blocker in C2).
- Coord RSS step root-cause (audit hypothesis ruled out in C1).

## [0.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-04-20

Observability + OBS-native audit + async SDK. B1-B6 (minus B7 soak
which runs past tag and updates LIMITATIONS §13 after).

### Fixed
- G5 namespaced reads returning `No Lance shard found`: worker now
  applies the `/` → `__` shard-name sanitisation on the read path
  (beta.2 did it only on writes; the unit test didn't cover the
  read-accept case).

### Added
- B1 worker-side traceparent re-emission.
- B2 OBS-native audit sink (put-per-batch).
- B3 optional OTLP exporter (`--features otel`).
- B4 Grafana dashboard + README + alert snippets.
- B5 `MetaShardState::all_tables_for_namespace` + `list_tables`
  pushdown.
- B6 `AsyncLanceForgeClient` covering search/insert/create_table/
  drop_table/list_tables/count_rows.
- `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` (three-pillar walkthrough + OTLP pipeline).

### Changed
- `AuditSink::spawn` routes OBS URIs to the new batch-PUT backend
  instead of failing startup.
- `validate_audit_path` now only rejects empty strings.
- `lanceforge` Python package exports `AsyncLanceForgeClient`;
  `__version__` bumped to `0.2.0-beta.3`.

### Deferred to 0.3
- Worker-side OTLP span emission, REST bridge, span attribute
  enrichment, coord-side sampling.
- Async SDK: upsert, batch_search, create_index, rebalance.
- Audit sink retry on PUT failure.

## [0.2.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-20

Posttag hardening for beta.1. F1-F9 close the "shipped-but-not-
wired" gaps surfaced in the beta.1 postmortem, plus one unplanned
lancedb-panic fix discovered by the new end-to-end tests.

### Fixed
- G5 namespace + lancedb panic: coordinator now sanitizes `/` → `__`
  in the `shard_name` passed to lancedb, which previously
  `.unwrap()`ed on validation and panicked the tokio task. Worker
  adds an input-validation guard for belt-and-braces. User-visible
  `table_name` keeps `/` everywhere else.
- G7 OBS audit path silent drop: `validate_audit_path()` rejects
  `s3://` / `gs://` / `az://` URIs at config time; coord exits 2.
- G7 audit sink channel-full invisibility: new
  `lance_audit_dropped_total` Prometheus counter.

### Added
- F1 `Metrics.audit_dropped_count` + counter export.
  `AuditSink::spawn(..., metrics)` signature.
- F2 `lance-integration/tools/e2e_h25_coord_uptime_test.py` nightly
  regression for the H21 shutdown-timeout bug.
- F3 + F4 `lance-integration/tools/e2e_beta2_ns_audit_test.py`:
  7 gRPC e2e assertions covering the namespace allow/deny path,
  ListTables filter, and real-RPC audit record landing.
- F5 admin S3MetaStore round-trip test.
- F6 `lance-admin meta restore --dry-run` and `--yes` flags;
  purge without `--yes` on non-TTY refuses to proceed.
- F7 `SECURITY.md` §5: storage-layer isolation caveat boxed at
  top.
- F8 Python SDK `LanceForgeClient` strips proxy env vars by
  default; opt-out via `respect_proxy_env=True`.
- F9 `AuditRecord.trace_id` top-level JSONL field (additive).

### Changed
- `AuditSink::spawn` signature now takes `metrics: Arc<Metrics>`.
- `cmd_restore` signature takes `(meta, from, purge, dry_run, yes)`.
- `open_store` in admin routes `file://` and `memory://` through
  S3MetaStore so the CLI accepts every URI form the coordinator
  config does.

### Deferred to 0.3
- Real OBS-append audit sink (R3).
- Full OTLP exporter pipeline.
- Grafana dashboard template bundle.
- Async Python SDK.
- MetaStore-side namespace enforcement.
- Worker-side traceparent re-emission.
- 4h+ soak to characterise worker RSS step cadence.

## [0.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-19

First beta on the SaaS-first track. Closes the Severity-1 gaps
from `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` — multi-tenant namespace,
per-key quota, persistent audit log, encryption-at-rest
documentation, operator CLI, cross-process trace correlation.
Backward compatible with 0.2.0-alpha.1 on wire and on disk.

### Added
- API-key ↔ namespace binding (G5). `ApiKeyEntry.namespace` rejects
  RPCs whose `table_name` doesn't start with `{ns}/` and filters
  `ListTables` through the caller's prefix. Admin keys without a
  namespace retain operator access. See `docs/SECURITY.md` §5.
- Persistent audit log (G7). `security.audit_log_path` turns on an
  append-only JSONL sink for every DDL / write RPC. Records carry
  timestamp, principal, target, details, and the W3C trace_id when
  present. OBS URIs currently warn-and-drop (tracked R3) — use a
  local path with Vector / Fluent Bit until 0.3.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` (G8). Threat model, TLS config, RBAC +
  namespace scope, SSE-KMS / SSE-S3 / SSE-C pattern, audit log
  ingestion, key rotation, hardening checklist.
- `lance-admin` operator CLI (G9). `meta dump` / `meta restore` /
  `meta list` / `shards list`. Shard file transfer is left to
  cloud-native tooling — `shards list` prints the URIs.
- Traceparent pass-through (G10). Coordinator parses W3C
  `traceparent` metadata and writes the 32-char trace_id into the
  stdout audit line and the JSONL record's `details` field.

### Changed
- Dev profile now builds with `debug = "line-tables-only"` and
  `split-debuginfo = "unpacked"`. Integration test binaries shrink
  from ~1.5 GB to ~300 MB without losing panic stack traces. See
  `docs/BUILD_HYGIENE.md`.
- `.cargo/config.toml` added with `build.incremental = true`
  explicit, sparse registry, and `cargo small` / `cargo prune`
  aliases for routine work.
- `crates/meta/src/state.rs` tests migrated off hardcoded
  `/tmp/lanceforge_metastate_*.json` paths (nanosecond-collision
  FileMetaStore lock race under parallel `cargo test`; same root
  cause as H23 in store.rs). Uses `tempfile::tempdir()` now.
- README feature matrix updated with G5 / G6 / G7 / G8 / G9 / G10.
  Test count badge 272 → 311.

### Deferred to 0.3
- OBS-native append for the audit log (R3).
- Full OpenTelemetry exporter pipeline (OTLP collector).
- Grafana dashboard template bundle.
- Async Python SDK (`grpc.aio`).
- MetaStore-side namespace enforcement (today's G5 is API-layer).
- Worker-side `traceparent` re-emission on outbound gRPC.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-04-18

First alpha on the SaaS-first track. Closes every alpha gate in
`docs/ROADMAP_0.2.md` §3.3 at minimum-viable depth. Backward
compatible with 0.1.0 configs and persistence.

### Added
- Runtime API-key rotation (B1.2.3). When `metadata_path` is
  configured the coordinator bootstraps config keys into the
  MetaStore and reloads the live registry every 60 s. Rotating a
  key no longer requires a coordinator restart.
- Read/write role routing (B2.2). New `ExecutorRole` config field
  (`either` / `read_primary` / `write_primary`); coordinator routes
  queries toward `ReadPrimary` and writes toward `WritePrimary`
  with a soft-preference fallback. Recommended high-write config
  (`replica_factor: 2` + `read_consistency_secs: 60` + role split)
  recovers mixed-RW read QPS to 82.5 % of the read-only baseline
  (was 38 % on 0.1.0).
- Compatibility policy (`docs/COMPAT_POLICY.md`, B3.5). Three-
  dimensional contract covering wire / persistence / config evolution
  rules.
- Branch-coverage baseline on the four critical modules
  (`docs/COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`, B4-min). Numbers are the honest
  starting point; future PRs may only ratchet upward.
- Chaos harness (`chaos/runner.py`, B5-min) with two scenarios:
  `worker_kill` (SIGKILL during traffic) and `worker_stall`
  (SIGSTOP for 5 s). Ten iterations each, 100 % pass gate.
- Soak harness (`soak/run.py`, B6-min). Samples per-process RSS
  and open-fd count every 60 s; alpha gate is 2 h run with < 3 %
  drift.

### Changed
- `ApiKeyInterceptor.keys` moved from `Arc<HashMap>` to
  `Arc<RwLock<Arc<HashMap>>>` so reloads atomically swap the
  registry without blocking request handlers.
- `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` §11 now carries the B2.2 numbers and the
  recommended production config explicitly.

### Notes for Operators
- If you've pinned `deployment_profile: saas` in 0.2.0-pre.1, no
  further action needed — the key hot-reload activates as soon as
  you restart against the 0.2.0-alpha.1 binary.
- Legacy `api_keys` (non-RBAC form) still default to `Admin`; flip
  to `Read` is scheduled for 0.3.0. `COMPAT_POLICY.md` §9 tracks it.

## [0.2.0-pre.1] - 2026-04-18

**Pre-alpha on the SaaS-first track.** Opens the 0.2 cycle with the
statelessness audit, configuration guards, and schema-versioning
foundations. See `docs/ROADMAP_0.2.md` for the full 0.2 milestone
exit criteria; this release meets none of them yet but lays the
plumbing every later step needs. Backward compatible with 0.1.0
configs and data snapshots.

### Added
- `deployment_profile` config field (`dev` / `self_hosted` / `saas`).
  `saas` hard-rejects local `metadata_path` values at startup; new
  deployments should always pin this explicitly. See
  `docs/STATELESS_INVARIANTS.md` (Gaps C + D now closed).
- MetaStore snapshot now carries `schema_version`. Current version is
  1. Pre-0.2 snapshots (no field) auto-upgrade on next write; future
  versions (>CURRENT) are rejected at load time so an older server
  can't corrupt forward-version state.
- `HealthCheckResponse` advertises `server_version` (populated from
  CARGO_PKG_VERSION). Clients can use it for capability negotiation.
- `docs/ROADMAP_0.2.md` — single forward-looking plan for the 0.2
  cycle. Supersedes the now-archived Phase-1..17 plans under
  `docs/archive/`.
- `docs/STATELESS_INVARIANTS.md` — SaaS-readiness audit. ~75% of
  state is already object-store-hosted or local-cache-safe; the
  remaining 25% lives in 4 specific gaps (A-D), 2 of which close in
  this release.
- `docs/PROFILE_MIXED_RW.md` — ongoing profile for mixed read/write
  performance (B2). Includes the first empirical falsification:
  `read_consistency_secs` sweep shows H1 (version-tick cache churn)
  only explains ~25% of the 10 QPS writes degradation.

### Changed
- Connection pool now replaces the whole `WorkerState` (including
  the tonic Channel) whenever a worker transitions from unhealthy
  back to healthy, closing the post-restart UNAVAILABLE flake.
- `LIMITATIONS.md` §11: read/write mixed performance numbers refreshed
  against a Phase-18-enabled cluster. The worst-case degradation at
  10 QPS writes is now -62% (was -91% pre-Phase-18, measured on the
  same hardware).
- `--auto-shard` CLI flag now requires `deployment_profile=dev`.
  Non-dev profiles exit with a specific error; the `/tmp` output
  path is downgraded from info to warn so operators stop leaning on
  it. The full MetaStore-backed auto-shard bootstrap is tracked as
  B1.2.2b.
- Cargo workspace uses `default-members` to restrict plain
  `cargo build` / `cargo test` / `cargo clippy` to the six LanceForge
  crates. Ballista stays in the workspace for future SQL-analytics
  reuse (Moat M2) but no longer compiles by default.

### Removed
- `crates/common/src/persistent_state.rs` (562 LOC). Replaced by
  `MetaShardState` + the File/S3 MetaStore split in Phase 7; kept ~10
  self-referential tests propping up a dead code path. No production
  callers.

### Fixed
- Post-worker-restart flake in `e2e_ha_test.py` scenario 7 ("worker
  recovered, cluster fully healthy"). The retry window is now tight
  (3×1s) precisely because the warm-up fix above is supposed to
  converge within one health-check tick.

### Notes for Operators
- The default `deployment_profile` is `dev` to preserve 0.1.0
  behavior; 0.1-era configs work unchanged. Production deployments
  should pin `deployment_profile: saas` (for managed offerings) or
  `self_hosted` (for customer-run installs). Running without a
  pinned profile in production is now tracked as an audit finding.
- Short-term mitigation for mixed read/write QPS loss: set
  `cache.read_consistency_secs: 30` (or higher). Data shows this
  recovers ~25% of the QPS gap at 10 QPS writes without changing
  any code. Proper fix lands in B2.2 (planned: read/write path
  physical split).
